## About me
Before developing, I consider myself an enthusiast for physics, mathematics, logic, nature and analytical properties of all things. After a while, I realized that I could put the ideas into binary form.

I always take it with me: mainly improve your learning skills. Tools are volatile, they change every period of time. Therefore, knowing how to learn and adapt to situations is the most important trail.
